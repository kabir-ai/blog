        "Fast image processing is important to efficiently research and deploy computer vision models. During my research i found that some people whom i admire Jeremy Howard who has built the amazing fastai library uses Pillow-SIMD ( a more effiecient version of Pillow library). Furthermore the awesome Pytorch library uses pillow. So i set to do a small experiment to compare OpenCV which is my standard go to library for image processing with Pillow-SIMD.\n",
